# lem_in
**school project**: a project about max flow algorithm implementation.

## ABOUT
*** WIP ***
*lem_in* is a program that directs "ants" through an "antfarm" (i.e. through a graph's nodes/vertices).

The project familiarizes the student with graph-theory and invites them to explore different algorithms best suited for flow optimization.
In my case (and AFAIK most of the other students at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/fi/) who also have completed this project) the algorithm of choice here was the [Edmonds-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm), which does a breadth-first search of the graph, in order to find the shortest path as well as the augmenting paths from source to target (end/sink/etc.).
